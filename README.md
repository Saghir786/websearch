# websearch
Javascript code to search a website for a search term

The task was to build a web crawler which crawls a given web domain searching for a given term and returns a list of related web pages.

For example:
Given the domain bbc.co.uk and the search term Renault you should return a list of links such as https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52845849.

The crawler should only crawl sites corresponding to the given domain.

Eg/ if the domain is bbc.co.uk you should crawl bbc.co.uk/news but not news.bbc.co.uk.
